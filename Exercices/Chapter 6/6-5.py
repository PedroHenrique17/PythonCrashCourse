# Make a dictionary containing three major rivers and the country
# each river runs through. One key-value pair might be 'nile': 'egypt'.

# Use a loop to print a sentence about each river, such as The Nile runs
# through Egypt.

# Use a loop to print the name of each river included in the dictionary.

# Use a loop to print the name of each country included in the dictionary.
