# Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few lines summarizing what youâ€™ve learned about Python so far.
# Start each line with the phrase In Python you can. . . . Save the file as learning_python.txt in
# the same directory as your exercises from this chapter. Write a program that reads the file and prints what you wrote
# three times. Print the contents once by reading in the entire file, once by looping over the file object, 
# and once by storing the lines in a list and then working with them outside the with block.
