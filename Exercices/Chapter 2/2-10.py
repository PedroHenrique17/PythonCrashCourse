# Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. 
# If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, 
# just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. 
# Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

# Ok I'm not gonna do that, I can do it for one program though:

# Program 2-7.py

# Name: Pedro Henrique 03/09/22 - 13:45
# This program gets a string with a famous person name and a lot of extra spaces and gets rid of the spaces
