# Use a variable to represent a personâ€™s name, and include
# some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure
# you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
# Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
# Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(),
# rstrip(), and strip().

print(name + '\n')
