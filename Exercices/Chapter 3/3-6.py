# You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is
# available. Think of three more guests to invite to dinner.

# Start with your program from Exercise 3-4 or Exercise 3-5. Add a print()
# call to the end of your program informing people that you found a bigger
# dinner table.
# Use insert() to add one new guest to the beginning of your list.
# Use insert() to add one new guest to the middle of your list.
# Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list.
# Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.
